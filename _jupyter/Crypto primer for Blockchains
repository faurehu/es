I recently explained the blockchain to a complete newcomer and was made very solid questions. I found difficulty explaining the concepts in an order I was not familiar with (explaining proof-of-work before blocks, for example) but I think I was able to manage to put everything in order to my conversation partner, as long as I did not talk about the cryptography.

I also flaked at what basic concepts should be, like digital signatures or the block puzzle. Here, I will write a revision on these topics and will keep them down for my own purpose.

What is the purpose of proof of work?

We need work to lock blocks under some sort of safety. By requiring a big amount of work for each block, and burying each block behind another one, we make sure that the difficulty of editing a transaction becomes more difficult.

What does the puzzle consist of?

It's trying to find a hash with the required number of zeroes.

How do we prove we control an address?

Digital signatures.
