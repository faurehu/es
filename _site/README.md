# Build instructions

`.markdown` files in the `_post` directory will be listed if they contain a YAML front matter block.

To convert a `.ipynb` file call `jupyter nbconvert file.ipynb --to markdown`, add the front matter block to the produced markdown file, move the images to the `/assets/images` folder and correct the paths.
