Ok, we get it. You've been told by a techie friend who also happens to be very busy that if you opt for hiring an agency to build your MVP, you'll end up with technical debt. Whatever it means, it's not good for you and you need to find a co-founder who understands all this technical gibberish and will land your ideas into reality so you can finally start cashing in on that visionary talent you were born with.

I was going to write a post titled "How to Convince Someone to be your Technical Cofounder", but I decided it'd be much less insulting to anyone reading if I just wrote a rant about specific people I tend to come across at technology meetups. The ones on a romantic search for a partner to make their illusions come true. Their pitch might not be crass and the idea could have potential, but when asked about the progress done so far they say it's not possible to do anything until they have something to sell, and so they need someone to build it first so they can get started.

No one is ever going to join your team if you keep that mentality.

The current macroenvironment has disbalanced supply and demand. Experienced developers are scarce, and they are already earning six figure wages. Ideas are cheap, execution is hard. Teams are crucial and no one is going to jump ship to join your unexistant startup if you can't show your worth.

Don't ask for someone to be your technical cofounder, instead, brag about your project. Anyone slightly interested will ask you about the status of your product and you can mention that you're waiting for the right talent to ask to build it with you. For now, you're doing everything else, and that's a lot to handle too!

Be ready to receive feedback. If you don't get any, ask for it. No one's going to identify with every detail in your vision right after your pitch. There's going to be that lukewarm sensation but there'll be some details people will want to polish so they can start feeling a sense of ownership. Almost right away, developers will start thinking about how to build the product and point out the pain points, pay attention to these.

Whatever qualifications you have, make them visible. Get their email address and shoot whatever material you have. If you're a project manager these should be user profiles and stories. If you're an UX designer show your journeys, sketches and wireframes. It's nice you met your charity fundraising goals before the marathon, but if you don't have a pitch deck then you're not really running. Ideally, you'd have all of this ready but hey, a display of elbow grease will do.

It also helps to show your thinking. Mention how you've arrived to the conclusion that he or she is the one. When did you first witness synergy? How have you tested their skills? What made their passion noticeable? If you'll take anybody who can write code then you're evidently desperate. You're not just looking for a codemonkey to lay bricks, you need somebody to own the mission with you.

These tips should help anyone not only to entice people to join their team, but most importantly, to not annoy the hell out of people.
